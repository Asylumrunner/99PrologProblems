# 99PrologProblems
My attempt to solve Werner Hett's 99 Prolog Problems

## Introduction
Warner Hett's 99 Prolog Problems are a collection he assembled whilst teaching in Switzerland. Divided into seven sections, the 99 problems are meant to provide practice for the programmer attempting to master Logical Programming.

The 99 Prolog Problems, as more as more details about them, can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).

I ended up discovering the P-99 after having to program a series of simple Prolog predicates for my Organization of Programming Languages class at UTD. I actually found Prolog to be an extremely fun language to program in. I sought after more problems than the simple 8 assigned to me, and I found the P-99.

## The Seven Sections

The seven sections of the P-99 are List Processing, Arithmetic, Logic and Codes, Binary Trees, Multiway Trees, Graphs, and Miscellaneous. These seven sections cover quite a few of the problem spaces that Logic Programming can handle best: those which involve decision making given data.
